Selection sort is taking the least val and placing it in the least index.

[3,4,7,8,2,5,6,9]
will take 2 and place it in index 0 - 
0 is the least index and 2 is the least number
- least index = 1
- least number after 2 which is 3 will be at index 1.
- Because it takes a lot of time to sort since it has to go through the entire list
